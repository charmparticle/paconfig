# paconfig

Introducing a new way of managing your pulseaudio outputs, totally from the commandline.

dependencies: slmenu, pactl

Simply run this script, choose which sound device you want to configure, then choose how you want it configured.
For example, you could set your system output device to be your headphone jack or hdmi out, or turn off hdmi out,
all from the commandline, in an easy-to-understand way.

The script gives you a chance to back out and not make any changes. Go ahead and try it :-)
